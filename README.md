# Holberton Smiling School

In this project, I had to implement from scratch, without Bootstrap, a web page.

Here are the constraints:

-   the web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is `576px` or less
-   the web page must switch to the tablet version when the screen width is `768px` or less
-   hover/active: `opacity: 0.9`
